# abstract 

The use of technocratic decision-making is an important aspect of policymaking in the US, yet little work has examined public opinion about technocracy. Using data from a US national survey, I explore differences in support for technocracy and the implications of that support for views about controversial energy sources and climate policies. Overall, I find that liberal Democrats, moderate/conservative Democrats, and moderate/liberal Republicans were more likely than conservative Republicans and moderate independents to support technocratic decision-making. In addition, I find that as support for technocracy increases, so does support for all energy sources and climate policies. Finally, I find interaction effects between technocracy support and political beliefs with those in the political middle  most impacted by technocracy views for energy sources and conservative Republicans most impacted for climate policies.
